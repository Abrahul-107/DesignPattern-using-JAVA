 A graphical overview of the **Collections in Java**, illustrating the hierarchy of collection interfaces and classes. It shows the relationships between key components such as `List`, `Set`, `Queue`, and `Map`, and highlights the main classes implementing each interface (e.g., `ArrayList`, `HashSet`, `LinkedList`, `HashMap`). This diagram helps developers understand the structure and usage of Javaâ€™s Collections Framework.


## Java AbstractList Overview

- **Description:**  
This image is a diagram explaining the **AbstractList class in Java**, which is part of the Collections Framework. It shows how `AbstractList` sits between the `List` interface and concrete implementations like `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, and `Vector`. The diagram highlights `AbstractList` as a skeletal implementation that helps developers create custom list implementations by providing default method implementations.
